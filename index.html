    <p>Help for continuing life and treatment of a person with a chronic illness living in a 1.5 by 1.5 meter container and assistance for getting through difficult days</p>

    <p>Hello to everyone whose heart is familiar with kindness.  
    I am a 47-year-old man living with a chronic illness. I wrote these lines with respect and hope—for those who still believe in second chances and bright hearts.</p>

    <p>Every day, I must take specific medication. Even with treatment, simple daily tasks have become difficult. Most places are unwilling to hire someone in my condition. I live in a small container, measuring 1.5 by 15 meters, under very tough circumstances. My life truly depends on the generosity of kind-hearted people.</p>

    <p>Due to this ongoing illness and situation, I urgently and continuously need essential support from compassionate individuals—now and in the future.</p>

    <p>If you are able to offer financial help—even a small amount, like half a dollar—it can make a meaningful difference in my life</p>

    <p>In a world where a small gesture can build great hope, your support reflects the true meaning of humanity.</p>

    <p>Two real photos on this page show the conditions I currently live in.</p>

    <p>If financial help is not possible for you, I am still deeply grateful if you do whatever you can—just enough to feel you’ve truly played a part in rebuilding a life.</p>

    <p>Please share the link to this page with others—especially those who might be able to help—or in groups, forums, and places where kind people gather. Even a simple share can create real change.</p>

    <p>From the bottom of my heart, I pray that every hand extended toward me in kindness receives many times more in the form of health, peace, joy, and blessings—for themselves and their loved ones.</p>

    <p>And beyond this world, may your pure intention be infinitely rewarded by the One who created everything—in a realm some call heaven, light, or liberation.</p>

    <p>A place where kindness, peace, forgiveness, and purity of heart live together.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to read these few lines  
    Wherever you are , I wish you health, peace , and kindness</p>
